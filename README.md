# Credit Card Fraud Prediction: EDA, ML, & Evaluation

This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning (ML) model building, and evaluation for credit card fraud prediction. The goal is to identify fraudulent transactions based on a dataset of credit card activities.

## Project Structure

The core of this project is a Jupyter Notebook that guides you through the entire process, from data loading and cleaning to model training and performance evaluation.

-   `fraud_detection.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for EDA, ML model development, and evaluation.

## Datasets

This project utilizes two datasets obtained from Kaggle, related to credit card fraud:

1.  **Training Data:** `fraudTrain.csv`
    -   **Source:** [https://www.kaggle.com/code/ambarishdeb/credit-card-fraud-prediction-eda-ml-evaluation/input?select=fraudTrain.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ambarishdeb/credit-card-fraud-prediction-eda-ml-evaluation/input?select=fraudTrain.csv)

2.  **Test Data:** `fraudTest.csv`
    -   **Source:** [https://www.kaggle.com/code/ambarishdeb/credit-card-fraud-prediction-eda-ml-evaluation/input?select=fraudTest.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ambarishdeb/credit-card-fraud-prediction-eda-ml-evaluation/input?select=fraudTest.csv)

**Before running the notebook, ensure you have downloaded these two CSV files and placed them in the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook.**

## How to Run This Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.7+). You'll also need `pip` for package management.

### 2. Install Required Libraries

Navigate to your project directory in your terminal or command prompt and install the necessary Python libraries. It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
